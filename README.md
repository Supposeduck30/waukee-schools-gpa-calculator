## üõ†Ô∏è How to tweak for your own uses
1. Fork the repository
   
2. Clone the fork
   
3. Make your changes to the code
   
4. Commit and push your changes to the fork
   
5. OPTIONAL - Create a pull request if you want the main repository to change the code with what you changed

## ‚öôÔ∏è How it works 
- The code just runs the same function (the function that returns the gpa value from a letter grade) the same number times you have classes (which is inputted by the user)
- It then adds the result of that function to total GPA
- The number of AP classes * 5 is also added into the total
- That total then gets divided by the total number of classes

## üöÄ Upcoming Features
- Easier interface that makes it more efficient for users with a high amount of classes taken
  - It will asks how many classes had A+, A, etc

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warnings/Known Issues
- How WCSD works is that if a class is 2 semesters (9th) or 2 terms (10-12th), it calculates it as 2 seperate classes, so input accordingly
